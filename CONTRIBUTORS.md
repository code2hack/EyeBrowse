Agent/session registry for EyeBrowse, maintained jointly by the Planner and Manager under `AGENTS.md` Section 15.1.

The single JSON array below is the canonical registry. `(host, runtime, id)` identifies a session; `role` and `name` identify it in public GitHub attribution. Model labels are Owner- or runtime-supplied metadata, not role authority. `active` means assigned, not necessarily running; other lifecycle values are `paused` and `retired`.
